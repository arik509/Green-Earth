Ans: In JavaScript,var,let and const are used to declare variables. var is old,it can be redeclared or changed but sometimes causes bugs.let is block-scoped,and its value can be changed but cannot redeclare it in the same scope.Const is also block-scoped, but its value cannot be changed after declaring.


02.What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

Ans: In JavaScript forEach(), map(), and filter() all are loop through arrays but work differently. forEach() runs a function on each item but don't return anything, it is just used to perform small actions.map() also goes through each item but returns a new array with the results, often used to change data.filter() checks each item with a condition and returns a new array only with the items that pass that condition.

05.Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Ans: Template literals is used to simply create strings using backticks (``) without using quotes (").
